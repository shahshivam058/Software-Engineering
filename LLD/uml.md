UML : Unified Modeling Language :

- Managers Do Most Development work 
- we use words to communicate with each other 
- high chance of mis understanding 
- explaine complex scenario is impossible sometime 
- Picture is worth Thousand word 

- Using Image is less ambigious 
- Advantages : 
    - Less ambigious 
    - easier visulization 
    - easier to understand complex system 
    - Onboarding New Person is really easy 

- if we dont go via a diagram of any way of pictorial representation 
- using diagram far better then using words 
- there should be standeardation across diagram across 
- One Model Folled everywhere 
- UML : Unified Modeling Language 
- Standearditon on how to represent different software engineering concept in diagram 

- Structural :How code base is structured  
- Bhavioural :how a system works , how a feature works 

Types of structural and bhaviour diagram :
- Structured "
    - Class Diagram 
    - package diagram 
    - object diagram 
    - Component diagram 

- bhavioural diagram :
    - activity diagram 
    - usecase diagram 
    - sequence diagram 

class and usecase diagram are most used diagram 
read activity diagram 


- Usecase diagram :
    - Who is using 
    - different features and functionality supported by a software system 
    - who uses those functionality 
    - we represent functionality using oval 
    - 5 Keywords :
        - System Boundry : Represents the scope of system does not include amy outsourced feature 
        - system boundry is a square box include all kind of functionas 
    - Use case : 
        - Oval : REPRESENTS FUNCTIONALITY OF SYSTEM 
        - Verbs inside oval 
        - Its just verbs 
    - actor :
        - actual users are actor 
        - it should be noun : represents the user of system 
        - represent arrow between actor and usecase 
    

    - Independent usecase also part of checkout -
    - Includes - functionality of actual features 
    - to perform feature we need to do that 
    - multiple people has multiple views 
    - all users dont need all functionality 
    - some users only need some functionality 


class diagram :
    - Class 
    - Interface 
    - enums 
    - abstrect class

and relationship between them 
- extension of a class have attribute of another class
