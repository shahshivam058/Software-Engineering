"""
We Have Given Matrix of size N * N 

Primary diagonal: runs from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner.

Secondary diagonal: runs from the top-right corner to the bottom-left corner.

Sum = Primary Diagonal Sum + Secondary Diagonal Sum 

ğŸ‘‰ One catch: if the matrix has odd dimensions (like 3Ã—3, 5Ã—5), the center element gets counted twice (once in each diagonal). Typically, we subtract it once to avoid double-counting.
Primary diagonal =  1 + 5 + 9 = 15
Secondary diagonal = 3+5+7 = 15

Total =  15 + 15 - 5 = 25
