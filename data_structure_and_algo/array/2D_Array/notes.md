A 2D array is organized conceptually into a set of rows and columns. Think of it like a spreadsheet.

Rows: The horizontal sets of elements.

Columns: The vertical sets of elements.

Elements: The individual values stored at the intersection of a row and a column. Each element is uniquely identified by two indices: one for its row and one for its column.

While we visualize it as a grid, a 2D array is stored in contiguous memory locations, similar to a 1D array. The compiler flattens the 2D structure into a linear sequence. The two common storage methods are:

Row-major order: The most common method. The elements of the first row are stored consecutively, followed by the elements of the second row, and so on. Most programming languages, like C++, Java, and Python, use this method.

Column-major order: The elements of the first column are stored consecutively, followed by the elements of the second column, and so on. This is used in languages like Fortran and MATLAB.

Understanding this storage mechanism is important for optimizing memory access and performance, especially in scientific computing.

Declaration and Initialization
The syntax for declaring and initializing a 2D array varies slightly by language.

In C++:

C++

// Declaration
int matrix[3][4]; // A 3x4 matrix (3 rows, 4 columns)

// Initialization
int matrix[2][3] = {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}};
In Java:

Java

// Declaration and initialization
int[][] matrix = new int[3][4];

// Initialization with values
int[][] matrix = {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}};
In Python:

Python



# Declaration and initialization
matrix = [[0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0]] // A 3x2 matrix (3 rows, 2 columns)

# Initialization with values
matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
Python uses nested lists to represent 2D arrays.

Accessing Elements
To access or modify an element in a 2D array, you must specify both the row and column indices. The indices are usually zero-based, meaning the first row is index 0 and the first column is index 0.

To access the element in the i th row and j th column of a 2D array, you would use matrix[i][j].

For a column, you would use matrix[i][j].

For a 3x4 array named matrix, matrix[0][0] would be the top-left element, and matrix[2][3] would be the bottom-right element.
