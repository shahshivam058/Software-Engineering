Bruteâ€‘Force Approach:

    Start from the first character.
    Loop through all characters:
    If it's not a space, increment length.
    If it's a space, reset length to 0.
    At the end, return length (which represents the length of the last word).

Optimized Backward Approach:
    Starting from the last character, skip all trailing spaces.
    Once you hit a non-space character, start counting.
    Stop counting when you reach a space or the start of the string.
    Return the count.
    There is a  base case check if we reached at first char or not
