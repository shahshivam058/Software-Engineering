"""
Counting Sort is a non-comparison-based sorting algorithm used for sorting elements when the range of input values is known and limited, 
typically for integers.

Instead of comparing elements (like quick sort or merge sort), it counts how many times each value appears, then reconstructs the sorted array based on those counts.

Elements are non-negative integers
The range of elements is not very large compared to the number of elements

can we store freq of all elements from 1 to n
