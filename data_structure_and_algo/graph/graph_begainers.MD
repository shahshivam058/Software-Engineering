What is Graph ?

Graph is collection of node and edges 
Vertices (or Nodes): These are the objects or entities. They are typically represented as circles in diagrams.
Edges: These are the connections or relationships between the vertices. They are drawn as lines between the circles.

Linked List - Nodes and edges In linear form 
Tree - Node and Edges in hierarchical data structure





In Tree :

No of Node = 8
No of Edges = 7

Reason ?
each and every node have their own edge except the root node root node doesnt have any edge 
Tree will always have n - 1 edges where n = No of nodes 


In Graph :

Edge = 8 
Node = 9

There is nothing fixed that each node have only one edge Node can be connected to any other node no rules restrict us from doing that 



DIFF Between Graph and Tree :

Node can be connected to any other node 

Connectivity: Graphs can be either connected or disconnected. A connected graph has a path between any two vertices, whereas a disconnected graph is made up of multiple separate components.

Cycles: A graph can contain a cycle, which is a path that starts and ends at the same vertex. A great analogy for a graph is a social network, where people are vertices and friendships are edges. This network can have disconnected groups of friends and form many cycles (e.g., A is friends with B, B is friends with C, and C is friends with A).

Edges: The number of edges in a graph can range from zero to a maximum of V(V‚àí1)/2 for a simple undirected graph, where V is the number of vertices.

Tree :

Connectivity: A tree must be connected. This means there is always a path between any two vertices in the tree.

Cycles: A tree cannot contain any cycles. It's an acyclic graph. This is the single most defining characteristic that differentiates a tree from a general graph. If you add an edge to a tree, it will create a cycle. If you remove an edge, it will become disconnected.

Root and Hierarchy: A tree typically has a root node, which is the starting point of the tree. The nodes below the root are organized in a hierarchy, with parent-child relationships. This structure is not a requirement for a general graph.

Edges: A tree with V vertices always has exactly V‚àí1 edges. This is a direct result of its connected and acyclic nature.


Classification Of Graph :

1) Based on Type of edge 

Directed Graph :

- A directed graph (or digraph) is a set of vertices connected by edges that have a specific direction. Think of these as one-way streets. An edge from vertex A to vertex B, denoted as (A,B), allows travel from A to B, but not necessarily from B to A.

- Asymmetry: The relationship between vertices can be asymmetrical. An edge from A to B doesn't imply an edge from B to A.

- Representation: An edge is typically represented as an ordered pair of vertices, like (A,B), where the first vertex is the source and the second is the destination.


Undirected Graph :

- Think of an undirected graph as a network of two-way streets. The connections between vertices are mutual. If there is an edge connecting vertex A and vertex B, you can travel from A to B and also from B to A.


2) Based On weight of edge :



1) Unweighted Graphs
An unweighted graph is a graph where the edges do not have any associated numerical value or cost. In this type of graph, the only important factor is whether a connection exists between two vertices. All edges are treated equally. Think of it as a simple "on/off" relationship. The length of a path is determined by the number of edges it contains.



Simple Connections: The edges simply represent a connection or a relationship, like friendships on a social media site where all friendships are considered equal.

Shortest Path: The "shortest path" in an unweighted graph is the path with the fewest edges.

Primary Algorithms: Since all edges are equal, you can find the shortest path from a source to all other reachable nodes using Breadth-First Search (BFS).

Use Cases: Social networks, finding the shortest number of "hops" in a computer network, or solving a simple maze.

2) Weighted Graphs

A weighted graph is a graph where each edge has a numerical value, or "weight," representing a cost, distance, time, or any other measurable attribute. This weight is crucial for determining the optimal path. The length of a path is the sum of the weights of all its edges.


Key Concepts:

Costs or Distances: The weights can represent real-world values, like the distance between two cities on a map, the cost of a flight, or the time it takes to travel between two points.

Shortest Path: In a weighted graph, the "shortest path" is the one with the smallest total weight. A path with more edges can still be the shortest path if the weights on those edges are small.

Primary Algorithms: Finding the shortest path in a weighted graph is a common interview problem that often requires more complex algorithms:

Dijkstra's Algorithm: Used for finding the shortest path from a single source to all other vertices in a graph with non-negative edge weights.

Bellman-Ford Algorithm: Used when edge weights can be negative.

Use Cases: GPS navigation systems finding the fastest or shortest route, network routing protocols finding the most efficient path for data, or resource allocation problems.





In tree each node can be connected to either one or max 2 node we used to use class node in graph we can connect to any number of nodes .

we cant use concept of class here 

To Represent Graph we use 2D Array 

For Graph we have to insilize 

we will not get graph as it is 

we  will get  input no of nodes and no of edges 

now we need to identify connection between them 

we have to construct graph by our self 

What is an Adjacency Matrix?

An adjacency matrix is a way to represent a graph using a 2D array (or matrix). The size of the matrix is V * V, where V is the number of vertices in the graph. Each cell matrix[i][j] stores information about the connection between vertex i and vertex j. This representation is simple and intuitive, making it easy to understand and implement.


Input might be table consist of 2 cols 

Source - destination 

In case of weighted we can have 3 colums :

Apart from Source and destination there will be 3rd Column edge represents the weight between source destination 

Source - destination 

How It Works

The core idea is to create a grid where rows and columns represent the vertices of the graph. The value in a cell [i][j] indicates whether an edge exists between vertex i and vertex j.

For unweighted graphs: A value of 1 (or true) in matrix[i][j] means there is an edge from vertex i to vertex j. A value of 0 (or false) means there is no edge.

For weighted graphs: The cell matrix[i][j] stores the weight of the edge from vertex i to vertex j. If there is no edge, you can use a special value like 0 or infinity (
infty).

Directed vs. Undirected:

Undirected graphs: The matrix is symmetrical. If there is an edge between i and j, then matrix[i][j] will be equal to matrix[j][i].

Directed graphs: The matrix is not necessarily symmetrical. An edge from i to j will be represented by matrix[i][j] = 1, but matrix[j][i] might be 0 if there is no edge from j to i.




Advantages (Pros) üëç
Fast Lookups: Checking if an edge exists between two vertices i and j is a constant-time operation, O(1), which is incredibly fast. This is a major advantage for algorithms that frequently query for edge existence.

Simple Implementation: The concept is easy to grasp and implement with a 2D array, which is a standard data structure in all programming languages.

Disadvantages (Cons) üëé
Space Inefficiency: The biggest drawback is space complexity. An adjacency matrix always requires O(V ** 2) space, regardless of the number of edges. For a graph with a million vertices (like a social network), this would require a trillion cells, which is not feasible. This makes it a poor choice for sparse graphs (graphs with many vertices but few edges). Most real-world graphs are sparse.

Inefficient Traversal: To find the neighbors of a vertex i, you have to iterate through the entire row i of the matrix, which takes O(V) time. This is less efficient than an adjacency list for algorithms like BFS and DFS, which frequently need to find all neighbors of a vertex.

What is an Adjacency List?

An adjacency list is a way to represent a graph as a collection of lists. The core idea is that for each vertex in the graph, you maintain a list of all the other vertices it's connected to. It's essentially an array or hash map where each index or key corresponds to a vertex, and the value is a list (or set) of its neighbors.


A hashmap consist of key and list of int 
Key Represents The source node 
Value list represents which nodes are reachable from key 

hashmap atleast consist of N Values = Which is no of nodes 

Implementation Details:

Structure: It's usually implemented as an array of linked lists, or in many modern programming languages like Python, a hash map (dictionary) where keys are vertices and values are lists of neighbors.

Vertices: Each vertex is typically assigned an index from 0 to V-1 (where V is the number of vertices). The array is indexed by these vertex numbers.

Edges: For each vertex u, its corresponding list contains all vertices v that have an edge from u.

Undirected Graph Adjacency List
In an undirected graph, an edge between vertex A and vertex B is a two-way street. If you can go from A to B, you can also go from B to A. This symmetry is reflected in the adjacency list.


Implementation: For an edge between vertices u and v, you must add v to the adjacency list of u and, simultaneously, add u to the adjacency list of v.

Space Complexity: O(V+2E), which is simplified to O(V+E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges. This is because for every edge, you're making two entries in the adjacency list.

Example: Consider a graph with vertices {A, B, C} and edges (A, B) and (B, C).

Initialize an empty list for each vertex.

For edge (A, B): add B to A's list and A to B's list.

For edge (B, C): add C to B's list and B to C's list.

The final adjacency list will be:

A: [B]

B: [A, C]

C: [B]

In weighted we will store node as tuple which represents (node , weight)


Construction of Graph :

Identify no of nodes Create a hashmap where each node values is a key  and value for each key is empty list 

no go through  input 

Loop Through Input 2 d array 

identify source and destination 

in 2d array each row first element is source and 2nd is destination so 

againest each source add a value in list 


we can do same for every and graph is created 



When to Use an Adjacency List (The Default Choice)
Use an adjacency list when the graph is sparse (i.e., E is much less than V¬≤). This covers most interview problems.

Common Scenarios:

Traversal Problems (BFS/DFS): Problems like "Number of Islands," "Clone Graph," "Word Ladder," "Course Schedule," and "Shortest Path in an unweighted graph" require exploring all neighbors of a node. The adjacency list does this in optimal time.

Sparse Graphs: Social networks, road networks (usually), dependency graphs. These have many nodes but each node is only connected to a few others.

When Space is a Concern: You want to avoid the O(V¬≤) memory overhead, especially since interview problems often have large constraints.



When to Use an Adjacency Matrix (The Exceptions)
Use an adjacency matrix only when the graph is dense (i.e., E is close to V¬≤) AND your algorithm relies heavily on checking the existence of edges in constant time.

Common Scenarios:

Constant-Time Edge Lookups: If the core of your algorithm requires repeatedly asking "Is there an edge between i and j?" and this is the dominant operation, a matrix's O(1) lookup shines. This is rare in interviews.

Floyd-Warshall Algorithm: This algorithm for finding shortest paths between all pairs of nodes naturally uses an adjacency matrix and runs in O(V¬≥) time. The space of O(V¬≤) is acceptable here. (Example problem: "Find the shortest distance between all pairs of cities in a graph").

Small, Dense Graphs: If the problem states the number of vertices V is very small (e.g., V <= 100 or 500), the simplicity of coding a matrix might outweigh the space cost. It's easier to reason about.

Transitive Closure: If you need to precompute and store which nodes are reachable from which other nodes (using something like Warshall's algorithm), a matrix is the natural structure.


Decision Framework for Your Interview
Default: Start by assuming you'll use an Adjacency List. Think about how to build it from the input.

Ask a clarifying question: "Can I assume the graph is sparse, or do we know the approximate number of edges?" This shows you're thinking about the trade-off.

Check for the "Matrix" signals:

Does the problem mention "all pairs" of nodes?

Is the number of nodes n explicitly stated to be very small?

Is the primary operation checking if an edge exists thousands of times?

If yes to any of #3, justify your choice: "Since we need to check edges constantly and the graph is small/dense, I'll use an adjacency matrix for its O(1) lookups." Otherwise, stick with the list.
