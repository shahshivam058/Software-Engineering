# (bit << (31 - i))

"""
(bit << (31 - i))

bit = bit we want to place it can be either 1 or 0 
(31 - i ) represents the location where we place to bit 

(bit << (31 - i)) we are doing left shift to place bit at designated location 

ğŸ§® Why +=?
Because we do this in a loop, and we're accumulating the bits one at a time into res.

Initially, res = 0
First iteration: Add the reversed bit for i = 0
Second iteration: Add the reversed bit for i = 1
...
Last iteration: Add the reversed bit for i = 31


we can also write res |= (bit << (31 - i))
